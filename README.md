UCD Milestone Project: The Monkees Official Website

-------------Overview------------

I decided to follow the brief closely as I felt that this was the best way to 
simulate a real life scenario whereby a client would provide an unusual and 
challenging subject that i may not be familiar with.

I did a little research on The Monkees throught their webiste and took some
ideas from there in terms of aesthetic and style.

----------------UX-----------

I wanted the site to allow fans old and new to have a place where they could 
find a collection of the band's best music. I found the best way to do this was 
by linking externally thus allowing playlists such as on Spotify to feature all
their hits.

As a new fan I want to discover their music and their TV show so I can learn
more about them.

As an old fan I want to revisit thir classic hits using new technology 
such as Youtube and Spotify.

I decided to keep the same basic structure for each page and so created the
wireframe linked here: https://imgur.com/OlUQF9N to show the layout.

For the design/color scheme I decided to go with a throwback style using
colors and fonts that would have fit in back when the band were just getting
started in the 1960s.

---------------Features-----------

1. The homepage would show updated news about the band and also provide tour 
dates for fans to find out when the band is playing nearby.

2. The gallery shows a variety of pictures of band members.

3. The Audio/Video section would allow users to watch old music videos and 
episodes of the bands TV show and listen to the bands greatest hits.

4. The contact section would allow users to contact the band and potentially 
hire them to play at parties or functions.

In future these sections may be expanded to include more live performances.
It could be possible to livestream performances using youtubes "Live" function.
The gallery could be expanded to include images from every decade of the bands'
existence, perhaps allowing users to choose what year they'd like to see.

-----------Technologies Used-----------

HTML: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML 
and CSS: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets

The site is built on the foundations of HTML and CSS because this is the 
best way to create sites.

Bootstrap: https://getbootstrap.com/

I used Bootstrap to create the grid syestem used in the header and footer
as well as the form used in the contact page.


-----------------Testing------------

The site has been tested on Desktop, laptop and on mobile devices and has been
found to work and adjust to all screen sizes. The form on the contact page has
been found to work also. On the gallery pages the images stack properly when
the screen size is changed.


-------------Deployment-------------

I pushed the site to github where it is now hosted. I did this using the command
console located in the C9 interface. Some changes were made before each push.
